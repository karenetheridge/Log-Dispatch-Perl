README for Log::Dispatch::Perl

The "Log::Dispatch::Perl" module offers a logging alternative using standard
Perl core functions.  It allows you to fall back to the common Perl
alternatives for logging, such as "warn" and "cluck".  It also adds the
possibility for a logging action to halt the current environment, such as
with "die" and "croak".
